tesing: Python has two main frameworks to make unit testing easier: `unittest` and `PyTest`.[nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is an extension to unittest that makes it easier to create and execute test cases.[Hypothesis](http://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a unit test-generation tool that assists developers in creating tests that exercise edge cases in code blocks.[mimesis](https://github.com/lk-geimfari/mimesis) generates synthetic test data which is useful to apply in your tests.[testify](https://github.com/Yelp/Testify/) was a testing framework meant to replace the common unittest+nose combination.
building: `setup.py` is the traditional method for defining package metadata and dependencies. It uses `setuptools` or `distutils` to specify how the package should be built and installed. `pyproject.toml` file is now the preferred, modern way to configure Python projects. It separates the build system configuration from package metadata and supports multiple build systems (like `setuptools`, `flit`, `poetry`, etc.).

GitLab is a comprehensive DevOps platform that provides code hosting, CI/CD, code review, issue tracking, container registry and other functions.
CircleCI is recommended for small projects where the main goal is to start integration as soon as possible.
Travis CI is recommended when you are working on open source projects that should be tested in different environments.

In a cloud-hosted setup, setting up the environment is not something you need to worry about. CircleCI is a cloud-based system - no dedicated server required and you don't have to manage it. If you want to make customizations, there may be some problems: you may need some third-party software to make these adjustments. Also, while being a cloud-based system is an advantage on one side, it can also stop supporting any software and you will not be able to stop.
